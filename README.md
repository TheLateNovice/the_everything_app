                  The Everything App

This is the only page in the public repo for this. 

Following my grandfather's stroke, my grandmother had to take on all the day to day, finances and stocks. 

I decided to help by learning to program and code a web application that can manage her calendar with reminders, display banking details and pull live stock information. 

Due to the nature of the banking and live stock page, as I progress with this and learn more due to this I will retain only calendar on github. 

However feel free to take fork this calendar page and have a play with it however which way you'd like :) 

Happy coding! 

One is never too old to learn.
